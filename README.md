# Hardware Versus Software

**Hardware** includes tangible parts that make your computer run.

These could be external, such as your monitor, mouse, and keyboard, or internal, which is what's inside the computer like the hard drive or CPU (Central Processing Unit).

**Software** covers the programs and operating system within a computer.

Programs contain a set of instructions (an algorithm) that performs tasks on a computer. An operating system is a type of program that manages all applications within that computer. Common operating systems include Windows on Microsoft computers, and MacOS on Apple computers.
