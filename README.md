# Building Your Own Computer

This is a comprehensive list of every part you would need to build your own computer, plus what purpose each part serves:

### Processor
The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is your computer's brain. Essentially, it takes your input and converts them into actions for the computer to perform. When looking at different processors, don't be scared by all of the numbers - Intel® Core™ i9 Processor with 8 Core and 16 Threads! Let's break this down:
| Fancy Word | Meaning |
| ---------- | ------- |
| i9 | The processor's generation; i7 is older, i5 is oldest |
| Cores | Physical representation of a processor; how many brains |
| Threads | Virtual "cores"; how many thoughts per brain |

### Motherboard
Connects all of your other parts and allows them to communicate with each other.

### Video Card
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) can be the most expensive part of a computer. The better the GPU, the better it can process and run video games. It also helps if you're looking to do intensive video editing like the pros!

### Storage
Where your data is kept. Can be done through Hard Drive Discs (HDD), or Solid State Drives (SSD). While HDD's are the traditional storage method, SSD's use newer technology and have the ability to be much faster and quieter.

### Memory
Also called Random Access Memory (RAM), this is your computer's short-term memory. It keeps important information available and stores it for quick access, unlike unused programs which sit in your hard drive.

### Power Supply
A Power Supply Unit (PSU) provides your computer with power. The bigger and better your other parts (such as GPU), the more power and wattage your computer will need to be supplied to support these parts.

### Fans
Without a variety of fans airing out your computer's parts, it would overheat and break very quickly. Much like the human body, computers generate heat the harder they work. However, much unlike the human body, computer's don't have any way of regulating that heat without being cooled down. Liquid cooling is becoming trendy as well, but is often done for visual appeal rather than function.

### Case
Have you ever been anywhere like Best Buy and seen all of the fancy, lit-up computers? This is because they are built in cases with glass panels to showcase all of the cool technology inside. For traditional, non-gaming computers, however, cases came in all shapes and sizes and provide a sort of home for all of your hardware to stay protected.

### External Hardware
As mentioned, this covers monitors, a mouse, and a keyboard.

You may want a monitor with a better refresh rate (measured in Hertz) if you're playing a fast-paced game, or you may want a monitor with a higher resolution (more pixels per inch) if you're into watching movies and videos.
