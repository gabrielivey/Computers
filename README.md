# How Computers Work

A computer can simply be viewed as a tool. While something like a shovel helps people dig holes, a computer helps people think process information. But, what defines a computer? Humans can do "computing" too, right?

A computer system must be able to do four things to be classified as such:
1. Take input
2. Store information
3. Process information
4. Output the results

### Input
This is the action of putting information into a system (called data). You put input in through touch, through a microphone, a keyboard, a camera, etc. When you put on a VR headset, your movements are that computer's input!

### Storage
When the information is input, a computer is able to store it in its memory - permanently. This can happen through any sort of storage device, such as the computer's hard drive (see [Building Your Own Computer](https://github.com/gabrielivey/Computers/tree/Building-Your-Own-Computer)), or something like the cloud where information is stored on over the internet rather than on your device.

### Processing
After taking in your information, a computer does whatever its told to do to modify that information. It can function like a calculator, taking in your input of one number through your keyboard and subtracting it from another. It could take video data and upload it to a website such as YouTube.

### Output
Once data is changed, a computer has to present it back to the user in some way. It could do so through a display monitor, a video, or even by printing it onto a piece of paper. And, get this - when two computers connect, the output of one computer becomes the input to the other, and vice versa. Then this whole process starts over again. Crazy!
