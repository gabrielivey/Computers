# The World of Computers
### Final Project for INFOTC 1600 by Gabriel Ivey

---

Hello world! With this repository, I am going to cover the basics of computers - from hardware to software and all in-between. After reading through this tutorial, you should understand the basics of what computers are made of and how they work. And *maybe*, **hopefully**, you will have gained an interest in learning more on your own!

Although the information covered will be basic, these concepts are still relatively new to many people even my age. Thus, this tutorial is directed more towards pre-teens and middle schoolers to help get a head start for all of the tech classes I'm sure you'll be taking in high school and beyond.

Let's get started:
1. How Computers Work
2. Hardware Versus Software
3. Building Your Own Computer
4. Using a Computer
