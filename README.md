# Closing Thoughts

Technology is around us more than we may think. It is now essential to work, socialize, travel, and even survive via food and healthcare. With the world constantly changing, so too does our technology - but there is always somebody behind these changes leading the push towards innovation. I want to be that person. **You** could be that person!

Hopefully this tutorial inspired you to do your own research and dig deeper. And, of course, hopefully it taught you a few things you didn't know before.

As you go about your high school career and think about who you want to be, consider taking tech courses that interest and challenge you - whether that's programming or computer engineering, all are useful skills to have. Jobs in tech are rewarding in that you're essentially solving puzzles for a living, all while helping the world better communicate. Not to mention, they pay well and are often flexible in hours and work-from-home environments.

But you have so much time to plan for the future. So get out there and get learning! ~~Or, you could play video games on that fancy computer you're wanting to build.~~

Thanks for listening!
